* No arrows in networkx

Believe it or not, the popular network package =networkx= didn't have arrows to draw directed
networks. Instead, it used some ugly rectangles to indicate direction.

Networkx is a package that I use regularly, and I wanted to contribute to the open source community
that had given me so much, so I decided to implement the arrows.

Before, a network would look like this:

* Arrows in networkx
The flow I used for my contribution was the following:

 1. Open an [[https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/2757][issue]] on the networkx' github repo.
 2. After I was told the issue was worth it, I created a [[https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/2760][pull-request]].
 3. After some back and forth discussion, they pulled my code!

Now, a directed network looks like this:

This contribution really made me learn a lot about the code behind the drawings of networkx, but
also about =matplotlib=. I think that contributing to a project is a great idea to learn how to code
better and to give something to the community.
