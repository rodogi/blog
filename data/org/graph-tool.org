* Graph-tool

Recently, I discovered the python package [[https://graph-tool.skewed.de/][graph-tool]] for network analysis. The advantage of
=graph-tool= over the very popular =networkx= is the speed, as said by its creator:

Contrary to most other python modules with similar functionality, the core data structures and
algorithms are implemented in C++, making extensive use of template metaprogramming, based heavily
on the Boost Graph Library. This confers it a level of performance that is comparable (both in
memory usage and computation time) to that of a pure C/C++ library.
