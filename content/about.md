My name is Rodrigo Dorantes-Gilardi and I'm a postdoc researcher at [CSBIG Lab](https://csbig.inmegen.gob.mx/) under the wing of [Enrique
Hernandez-Lemus](https://csbig.inmegen.gob.mx/about/) and [Jesús Espinal-Enríquez](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=Aoa-qxcAAAAJ&hl=en).

My work is at the frontier between data science, networks, and bio-informatics.
