## Overall {#overall}

My Friend and mentor [Chucho](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?user=Aoa-qxcAAAAJ&hl=en#) told me about a [table](https://privilegiosfiscales.fundar.org.mx/) of people who's taxes were forgiven between
2007--2019 in Mexico came public recently. The information was compiled by Mexican association
Fundar, and it includes the year of the tax exemption, the amount and the entity. Tax exemptions
are classified in two types: cancellation and reduction.

Here, I focus on real people and tax reductions. Another analysis should be made including tax
cancellation and private companies. The time spans the presidency of three Mexican presidents, so
let's see who was forgiving who and when, whenever I say forgiven I'm really talking about a (in
some cases huge) tax reduction.

Three presidents:

-   Felipe Calderon Hinojosa (FCH): 2006--2012
-   Enrique Peña Nieto (EPN): 2012--2018
-   Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO): 2018--

  Amount forgiven In Million current Pesos
</div>

| FCH  | EPN  | AMLO |
|------|------|------|
| 5716 | 5792 | 12   |

The grand total of 12,000 Million pesos was forgiven between 2007 and 2019, with EPN and FCH being
the most merciful with 5,802 M and 5,706 M, respectively. AMLO has forgiven only 12 M so far, let's
see how this evolves next year in 2020.

When plotting the amount of pesos forgiven per year something struck me: The vast majority of the
tax-exemptions were done the two years after FHC became president and one year after EPN. Could it
be that this list of tax-exemptions is in actuality a list of debt payment?

Let's now see the favorite people of each president.


## Felipe Calderón Hinojosa {#felipe-calderón-hinojosa}

Felipe had a list of 1,290 friends to which he forgave a lot of dinero to. He forgave 96.6% of the
total during his first two years of presidency. He was most merciful with Carlos Efrain De Jesus
Cabal Peniche, to whom he forgave 500 M pesos. Second in the list is my home town local Miguel
Fernando Valladares Garcia with 221 M pesos.

## Enrique Peña Nieto {#enrique-peña-nieto}

EPN had more friends; 4,352 to be exact. And he forgave 94% of the money in his first year as a
president. He was indeed quick to repay his debts.

## Favorite people overall {#favorite-people-overall}

There is a list of 133 people that have been friends with both presidents. Interestingly, these
people are not friends with AMLO, as they weren't forgiven any money during his first year as a
President. Here is when they where forgiven their taxes.
